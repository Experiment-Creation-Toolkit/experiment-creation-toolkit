| **classificationMethod** | string | mandatory | - | The method or algorithm used to classify the data. Can be one of `"EQUAL_INTERVAL"`, `"JENKS"` or `"QUANTILES"`. For details on the algorithms used refer to the [geostats documentation](https://www.intermezzo-coop.eu/mapping/geostats/). |
| **colorScheme** | uri | mandatory | - | A string, representing the URL to the color scheme generated by [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org), e.g. `"https://colorbrewer2.org/?type=sequential&scheme=OrRd&n=3"`. Refer to the [How-To]() section to learn how to generate a color scheme using ColorBrewer. |

### MapData
| Property | Type | Requirement | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **source** | string | mandatory | - | The file name of the data to be visualized. You do not need to specify a whole file path, in case you put the file in the default data directory. Currently, only GeoJSON files are being supported. For example: `"LakeCounty_Health_NationalObesityByState_2015"` |
| **variable** | [Variable](#variable) | mandatory | - | The measured variable in the data to be visualized by the map. Refer to [Variable](#variable) for details. |
| attribution | [Attribution](#attribution) | optional | - | The attribution, containing the data's metadata. Refer to [Attribution](#attribution) for details. |

### Variable
| Property | Type | Requirement | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **id** | string | mandatory | - | The name of the variable provided in the dataset. See the [example](#example) below. |
| label | string | optional | "" | An alternative label for the variable in case the default name is not meaningful. The label is displayed in the map's legend for example. |
| unit | string | optional | "" | The unit of the variable. This is displayed in the map's legend for example. By default, no unit is being provided with the data. | 

#### Example 
Consider the following snippet from an example dataset:

```json
"properties": {
    "OBJECTID": 1,
    "NAME": "Texas",
    "VALUE": 32.4
}
```
If you want to visualize the variable `"VALUE"`, you have to specify the `id` as `"VALUE"`. Since the variable name is not very meaningful in this case, you can use an alternative label by providing the `label` property (e.g. `"Obesity"`). Since there is no unit being provided you can specify the `unit` property as well (e.g. `"%"`) to improve the description of your data.


### Attribution
| Property | Type | Requirement | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **url** | uri | mandatory | - | A string, representing the URL to the metadata of the provided dataset. |
| **label** | string | mandatory | - | The label to be displayed in the attribution (e.g. the name of the data provider). |
