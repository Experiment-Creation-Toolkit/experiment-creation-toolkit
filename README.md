# A Toolkit for the Creation of Online Experiments Evaluating Choropleth Maps

This toolkit aims for automating the creation on online experiments for evaluating the user experience of choropleth maps.

## Setup
### Option 1: Using Docker
1. Download and install Docker for your operating system from the [Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).
2. If correctly installed and booted up, the command `docker --version` should return the version you have installed:

```
4. Navigate to the cloned directory in your terminal, e.g.:
```bash
cd experiment-creation-toolkit
```
5. Create a new file in the root directory of your project called `.env` with the following content:
```bash
VITE_EXPERIMENT_ID = example

| attribution | [Attribution](#attribution) | optional | - | The attribution, containing the data's metadata. Refer to [Attribution](#attribution) for details. |

### Variable
| Property | Type | Requirement | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **id** | string | mandatory | - | The name of the variable provided in the dataset. See the [example](#example) below. |
| label | string | optional | "" | An alternative label for the variable in case the default name is not meaningful. The label is displayed in the map's legend for example. |
| unit | string | optional | "" | The unit of the variable. This is displayed in the map's legend for example. By default, no unit is being provided with the data. | 

#### Example 
Consider the following snippet from an example dataset:

```json
"properties": {
    "OBJECTID": 1,
    "NAME": "Texas",
    "VALUE": 32.4
}
```
If you want to visualize the variable `"VALUE"`, you have to specify the `id` as `"VALUE"`. Since the variable name is not very meaningful in this case, you can use an alternative label by providing the `label` property (e.g. `"Obesity"`). Since there is no unit being provided you can specify the `unit` property as well (e.g. `"%"`) to improve the description of your data.


### Attribution
| Property | Type | Requirement | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **url** | uri | mandatory | - | A string, representing the URL to the metadata of the provided dataset. |
| **label** | string | mandatory | - | The label to be displayed in the attribution (e.g. the name of the data provider). |
